#Kekkan

Kekkan is a parser and [ActiveRecord](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html) database for NVD CVE and CPE XML files.

The name comes from the Japanese word for 'flaw/defect'.

Version **0.0.1** is the current release.

# Requirements

##Ruby
Keigan has been tested with ruby-1.9.2-p320, ruby-1.9.3-p125. Please try to use one of these versions if possible. I recommend using RVM to setup your ruby environment you can get it [here](https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/).

### RubyGems
Kekkan relies heavily on [RubyGems](http://rubygems.org/) to install other dependencies I highly recommend using it. RubyGems is included by default in the 1.9.x versions of [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/).

- rails
- yaml
- nokogiri
